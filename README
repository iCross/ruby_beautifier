A ruby code beautifier/prettifier cleans ruby code for you [and give it the right indentation, etc.]

What it does:

you run rbeautify on poorly-aligned code, like

def go
if 3
stuff
end
end

and it automatically converts said code to

def go
  if 3
    stuff
  end
end

Quite convenient for those of us who edit using editors without auto format.  It also
helps find indentation mismatches [i.e. missing end's and }'s ] by cleaning
up the code so you can see scopes, and warning you where it sees mismatches [similar to ruby19 -w but better].

Many thanks to the original author [I just gemif-ied his existing script].
